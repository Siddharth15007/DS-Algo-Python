# DataStructure-Algorithm

### Day 1 of #100DaysChallange
##### Today, i learned about Binary tree and binary search algorithm. First, in BinaryTree contains three nodes left, root, right. There are also three traversal types of BinaryTree: PreOrder, PostOrder, and InOde.
##### And Secong, I compared two searching algorithm, simaple search and binary search algorithm. simple search algo takes O(n) time to search element and binary search takes O(log n) time.
